Use machine learning to match field recordings of birdsongs to a species
using the Cornell library of recordings as a training set.  Incorporate
species distribution from ebird records to inform the choices.


Nasa data - use vegetation cover, nightime light polution as factors to distinguish
habitat type/quality from gps
ebird data - determine spatial and temporal distribution
split search space by gps and timestamp info
train on macauly library data

perform recursively with subtraction to get multiple species or count information
look into autotune for signal preprocessing!
SVD for feature reduction, cosine similartiy to find species

look for neuroscience algorithms to pick signals out of noisy data

Abstract:

The goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model capable of
identifying unknown avian species in the field.  The model will be informed by
prior knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution taken from the ebird
database, user location and timestamp information taken from the user device,
and habitat factors inferred from satalite data.  The initial implementation
will be limited to a few species common in the Seattle area, but the goal will
be to expand the scope once a functional model has been established.


Predict first occurances of migratory species from historical data and weather
    and satalite data (temperature, veg. cover)

Predict protein folding from sequence and crystal structure data

Predict solution stability from delta free energy and solubility data from
    ammonium sulfate precipitation experiments - experimental data not really available

Find correlations in high throughput mass spec data

Machine learning proteomic/peptide map database search

Scrape web for beer ratings and recipes, predict recipes which will perform
    well at competitions
