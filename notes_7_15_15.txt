sql
relational database
    survives after process in  which it was created has ended
    written to non-volatile storage
    infrequently accessed and unlikely to be changed.

most business data is stored in a RBDMS

Why?
model relations in data
query data and their relations efficiently
maintain data consistancey and integreity

schema defines the structure of the data
    datavase composed of tables
        columns(fields)
        rows(records)
    column has a data type (integer, string, date, ...)
    row is an entry in the table with data for each field

    first task: understand the schema

every table needs to have a unique primary key
always fastest to search by primary key

foreign keys
    references some other entry in the database
    could be in same table or different
    faster to do joins using this key

shema normalization
    minimize redundancy
        details only stored once
        other tables reference that data

sql queries:
    SELECT
    FROM
    WHERE
