With the hawk perched atop a dead tree snag, the Flickers are excited and very vocal, even being aggressive. There was some vocal exchange between the two birds and the haw flew off. Later on the tape the Flicker is again recorded with one good sequence. [Note: The interaction between the Cooper's Hawk and Flicker continues without a break on LNS catalog number 25167, Accipiter cooperii cut #6. The Cooper's Hawk makes the lower pitched calls in the interaction.]  BNA: Drumming, tapping, Long Call, and possibly the Peah Call are heard.  CZ  11/03/2004.  [This recording has three parts and at least four different vocalizations.  The first part has one Drum (0:06, though certainly not by the calling bird and possibly not even from this species, given presence of Melanerpes formicivorus in the immediate vicinity), two ""Long Calls"" (0:09, 0:14), a single ""Wicka"" Call (0:21), and one ""Whurdle"" Call (0:33).  The second part has 12 ""Peah"" Calls (1:31-2:21, one overlapping a drum, posisbly by this species at 2:02) and two ""Whurdle"" Calls (1:56 - distant; 1:57 - better), and the third part has 19 more ""Peah"" Calls (2:31-3:25), four ""Whurdle"" Calls (singles at 2:29 (probably the best one in this cut) and 3:19, and two at 3:20), and another, apparently undescribed ""We-eeer"" Call that appears to have been given by this species (3:18).  This should represent C. a. collaris based on range and note above that it was a ""Red-shafted"" Flicker.  Quality changed from 2 to 2-3, 2 (maybe 2-1 but with some tape hiss)- CAM - 2 December 2004]",,,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,111070
