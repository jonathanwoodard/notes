Tenakee inlet is a very long glacial fjord that penetrates right into the center of chichagof, and we are on a rocky almost island btwn 2 salt marshes that are at the mouths of inlets that flow into upper tenakee inlet.  And we have chosen this beach bc it doesn¿t seem to be right in the middle of the bear activity around here which focuses on the river mouths.  The bears use the sedges in the spring and then they probably shift into salmon right now and this sight isn¿t too close to either one of those things.  What we want is a nice comfortable camp where we aren¿t listening for crunching noise all night and close access to this landmark stand I think we can find tomorrow. 4:43    4:44 cj - from here - where do we go tomorrow to find the stand? And how big do you think the stand is and how did you pick it?    4:55 RC we picked it mostly from air photos and I had heard from some friends in tenakee that there are some really big trees back here, but the place that we are going to visit - I haven¿t talked to anyone that has actually been in there before.  We tried to make it in last year with a high school group and got turned back by a river that was too deep to cross.  This year we will bring a raft and hope to paddle across.  The air photos looking through this little 3-d viewer we can judge the size of trees - their height - looks like a little terrain model  5;28 - and I think we will hike about a mile through more typical southeast alaskan old growth and open peet land.  Hopefully we won¿t be doing too much thrashing in the brush.  That will take us over about a 200 foot rise and then we will drop into a river bottom and then we can maybe get across that by fording or maybe have to use sam¿s raft.  And from there it should be too far to this patch of trees. 6:01    6:02 - CJ  you can see it hear - on the USGS map that shows elevations - and then you can compare that to what you see in the stereoscopic viewer and compare the 2 and give yourself and give yourself a fabulous eeler of where you are - let me have a look  - as well as the amount of trees    6:28 RC - yeah, you can pick out individual trees from that - that is a low elevation true-color shot taken from a mile or so up    CJ - and I can see at the bottom here - that is where the delta is - it has got some streams running through the middle of¿it is kind of cloudy - is that muskeg?¿¿¿¿¿¿.7:08 can you tell from looking in here where we are going to go?    7:11 RC - that particular image shows where we are camped and the beginnings of our hike tomorrow¿.    7:23 Cj - by ",Landmark trees; Richard Carstensen; Landmark trees; Sam Skaggs; Landmark trees; Sam Skaggs; Landmark trees; Richard Carstensen; Landmark trees; Richard Carstensen,Stereo=1; Decoded MS stereo,,,,900060
