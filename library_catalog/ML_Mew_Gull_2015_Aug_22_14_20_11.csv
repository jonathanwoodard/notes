The first part (0:14-0:19) contains calls much like those of Buteo lineatus, which comes nowhere near occurring at this site, so I suspect that these were given by the gulls.  Presumably these calls correspond to the excited Alarm Calls described and pictured in Figure III of Cramp et al. (1983. Handbook of the birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: the birds of the Western Palearctic. Vol. III. Oxford University Press, Oxford).  The second part (0:205-0:235) combines more typical Alarm Calls (Figure II) with three Anxiety Calls (0:208 and 0:216-0:22, Figure IV), the latter apparently corresponding to the ""kwew-kwew"" Alarm Calls of BNA.  The third part contains a single excited Alarm Call at 0:245, but I believe everything else here, both the duck-like quacking (0:245-0:29) and the three soft, ""peep"" notes (0:29-0:32), was given by the scaup noted above.  The fourth part contains one good Long Call in addition to six presumed Alarm Calls by a second individual (0:365-0:45).  I do not hear any gulls calling in the last part (0:50-1:02), which appears to represent only the quacking of a scaup.
