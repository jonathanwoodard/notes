Unlike the dichotomy pictured in Figure 2 of the BNA account, however, the songs in this recording either have or completely lack pure tones.  Songs having pure tones begin at 0:02, 0:08, 0:17, and 0:20, and those lacking pure tones begin at 0:04, 0:15, and 0:22.  There are also examples of both the ""check"" call of BNA and a sharper call scattered throughout this recording.  The first of these clearly represents this species, but I am less certain of the second call type, which despite sounding much like the calls of Sayornis phoebe, was probably given by the blackbird.
