The first half of the recording contains mostly calls but also intermittent songs.  Later in the recording, are mostly songs but with some calls.  At least two and apparently three birds are singing here.  Several different calls are also heard, but it is unclear which ones these are based on BNA account.  There are certainly many ""chink"" calls (e.g., 0:47-1:24), but also what appear to be ""sip"" of ""tsip"" calls (e.g., 2:20-2:25, 2:42-2:45, 2:50-3:00), and probably other call-types not mentioned in account.  A series of ""chatters"" (0:21-0:42), for example, is unlike anything described in BNA.  Also likely is that each of these calls is different in the ""Thick-billed"" birds relative to nominate P. iliaca, upon which most of BNA discussion is based.

The first call notes on the recording are the Evening Grosbeak (Hesperiphona vespertina).  MacGillivray's Warbler is the next prominant call, then there is a series of Fox sparrow calls with a song phrase that appears to contain imitations of Turdus migratorius tut-tut call notes.  Following this the recording turns into a series of Fox Sparrow with prominant MacGillivray's Warbler.  There is also a mountain quail flapping it's wings later in the recording.  - SBA 08 Oct. 2002 Location of recording unknown.

As far as I can determine, there are NO calls of Passerella here, and I am not sure that the sparrow ever sings in the short last part, which instead sounds like the song of Carpodacus cassinii.
