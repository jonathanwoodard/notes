This is the only finch listed at this refuge.  So I recorded it because some of my associates claim I have a Purple finch instead of a House Finch.  This takes care of them.  Actually, there is enough intraspecific variation up and down the coast so that it is, indeed, easy to get into a controversy.  I'll admit I have a hard time separating the finches anyway!  I have less trouble with the Cassin Finches, and am careful to tape them at the higher altitudes, such as Missoula, Montana, where everyone knows they are Cassin's.    BNA: The male song is heard.
