And his description of a Western Tanager as, you know, a robin that's got a sore throat is perfect and a Rose-breasted Grosbeak as a robin that's been taking singing lessons is just excellent.  It's interesting, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, which we may hear, has a very sort of sharp squeak-like call and a friend of mine has described it as a training shoe turning sharply on a wooden gymnasium floor and it describes it exactly. Once you've heard it you know it.
