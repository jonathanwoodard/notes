Oh you are.      9:24-10:41 uv  Now these chipping sparrows would come down from these tall pine trees and sing on the ground, very low.  So we need open parkland, where they would sing.  But what I was really hoping was that we'd get some bruer sparrows, very closely related, they're in the same genus.  They just haven't been studied, but I just know they do the same thing.  I remember back in 70, 1970, thirty years ago, standing like we are now with nothing singing, it was out the sagebrush in Central Oregon, and just suddenly all these birds just erupted around me.  So it had to be all these territory owners coming together at their boundary and then they sing this long canary like song.  It just seems like endless variety.  And then during the daytime, it's just a simple, two-parted song.  It just a different bird.  And it would be really exciting standing in the sagebrush among them.    10:46 uv  And the smell of the sage adds a whole new layer to it too.  Sensual overload.
