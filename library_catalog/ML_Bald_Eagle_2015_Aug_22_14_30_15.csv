(makes sound) noises like that when they get concerned they'll stop making those noises and a dull roar from the chest that means back off wait for a minute or two until they stop making that noise and start making loud noises again if you continue to walk forward when they're roaring we may scare them off the nest ....

(its a camera here's the lends ok) no. they can't? no they see them and we see them. so now you can start to, wow, i know, quite apart from getting a good idea of why they do well or do not, designing this sort of blind allows us to get close enough to figure out what's going on and as you can hear they are really loud birds. 9:34     all of them have eggs or chicks, colony     10:32 this is a herring coming in looks like.

(mirror)     18:15 oh they're all bobbing their heads hear the difference in noise that they make? a low roaring.... (sound) what just happened? there was a gull alarm you can still hear the edge of the gull alarm now the gulls are saying its okay don't worry everything is back to normal it flew off in another direction and so the murres decided it's okay too. 18:50     look at who brings in fish, what kind of fish, to get an idea of whether parent",Common Murre behavior and habitat; Time of Day: 1005; Time of Day: 1220,"Stereo=2: 1=L, 2=R; Decoded MS stereo",,,,900060
