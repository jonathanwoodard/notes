And what I wanted to do is sit here in the middle of the snow covered bridge, look down at the ice on Hay (?) Creek and have you guys envision a bunch of naked people out here jumping off and screaming bc this is our summer swimming hole [AC: laughter]. And then I want to envision if you can about 2 months later, towards the end of August and September there comes a time when the Huckleberries shriveled have fallen off of the bushes, and the Hawthorne bushes down here are loaded with berries. Big, plump, purple berries. And so the bears all come down from the mountains on both sides of the valley, and this place is one great big Grizzly Bear picnic area. And the Hay Creek has gone low by that time of year, and there is a lot of mud showing along the banks, and you can barley see a place on that mud that does not have Grizzly tracks all through it -and Black Bear tracks. But when enough Grizzlies move in the Black Bears move out. So there are interactions even btwn these two kinds of bears, and one good reason that Black Bears have to be able to climb trees is that adult Grizzly Bears can't. And adult Grizzlies will dine on Black Bears. Wolves will dine on young Grizzly cubs, and I think that's one reason young Grizzly cubs can still climb trees. Why else would they need to climb trees? [AC: right]. They've got a big parent to defend them against virtually everyone else. Maybe cougars. And what's interesting is that down here I'll see -again it is snow covered, we're picking out tracks here and there -but there are moose, there are lots of elk, and I'm going to show you where they winter, just across on an island full of 500 year old trees.   AC: 47:43 One of the things that learned from talking to Diane Boyd is that actually this is a good season for seeing signs of wildlife. You see the tracks of wildlife. Where they have been. She can't really follow the wolves in the summer nearly as easily as she can in the winter.   DC: 48:01 winter.... when -if and when it stops snowing here, we finally got a huge tablet running up and down 60 miles of this valley, telling us where the animals have left their signatures. And really, as part of f -what keeps you living here is that you can go out, and you can see all of the stories in the snow. The animals can be really hard to see. And we got short days, and it's tough, but you can always find the tracks. You can back track them and see where the maybe -in Diane's case you can see who is eating whom but which among the predators are -is it the bear? Did the bear chase off the cougar from a kill? Did the wolves then come in and chase the bear off?
