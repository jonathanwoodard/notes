Perched higih in an oak tree in my camp, his persistent calls by the hour finally got to me. The challenge was that this recording could be better in some way. The significant consideration was that I had a new recorder with different tapes and this was a try-out to test the quality, the feel for any overload and/or print through, if possible.
